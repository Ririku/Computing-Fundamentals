						<h1>Stressed Out, Who? Me!</h1>
					</header>
				I've been struggling for a while, and I'm been thinking about the way how to deal with it. So here's what I think: <p>
This semester has been so hectic and a lot of pressure before the deadline of each requirements.<p>
Despite the endless amount of homework, projects, and essays, exams are by far the most stressful.
 Sometimes you know when you half-assed a test, but other times, you actually do spend all week studying and working hard, and itâ€™s like a jab in the heart when you fail.<<p>
The first semester of my college life rips off my confidence wherein i feel like i didn't learn anthing from the past wherein i just cry my heart out every night till i fell asleep. 
I have endured a lot from the past, i have been broken, i have known hardship, i have lost myself. But here i stand, still moving forward, growing stronger each day. 
They made me stronger, i tend to cry easily but i know whatever college will throw at me i will face it, stumble and stand up.<p>
