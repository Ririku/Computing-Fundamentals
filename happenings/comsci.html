						<h1>College Life as a Computer Science student</h1>
					</header>
					<p>My entry into a college after I had completed my school education was an important event in my life. 
					I felt very much excited on the very first day. I found that there is a great difference between school and college life.
					The world of the school is narrow and limited. The world of the college is broad.
					<p>
					As a CS student as expected most of my subjects is all about codes codes codes and codes but i really did 
					take the CS course because of the digital arts.
					Well it's not really that bad to take still the programming course because in the near future it will serve as my advantage in applying job.
					<p>
					As a CS student everyday I always  run into error after error after error, develop a workflow that involves writing code,
					debugging, writing more code, 
					and so on then ending up writing another problem.
					<p>
					To be honest living as a CS student is very hard, you need to manage your time for you to get 
					your work done but sometimes ends without sleeping at all. 
					<p>And at the end of the semester to 
					all the activities i poured my time into let it result to another achievement. 
					<p>
					Well as they say the struggle i'm in today is developing the strength that i need tomorrow.
