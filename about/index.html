				Hi.  
			Obviously as you can see in my front page i am a Kpop Fan, a fan girl of a popular boy group BTS. <br>
			
			What does a KPOP boy group mean to a mere 18 years old fan girl? <br>
			Being a fangirl did affect me as a person, the way i dress, the way i want to dress and gives me more confident to look infront of the mirror, 
			and not feeling insecure.<br>
			Being a fangirl of those 7 boys inspire me to become a better version of myself to be myself.
			But now, I can say that I've become mature enough to know my priorities. Yes, I'm a fangirl but I am also a daughter, a student and a friend...<br>
			
			So what does BTS mean to me as a mature fangirl?<br>
			
			
			â™¦ INSPIRATION <bold> <br>
					BTS has always made a great impact to me, their song lyrics struck to me like a bullet. They inspires me a lot. 
				They are not just a boy group singing and making fan girls scream
				but a family who makes music and inspires other people through it.<br>
			
				To be honest, I want to be like them.<br>
				A small group in the past and now making a name in the indusrty, slaying music charts and making a succeful world tours.<br>
				I want to be as hardworking as them on whatever u may decide to do in the future. <br>
				And just like them I want to create my own name with my own hardwork.<br>
					
				Bangtan Sonyeondan..<br>
				Who are they? <br>
				For me? They are my INSPIRATION <br>
				For them? They are my OBSESSION<br>
