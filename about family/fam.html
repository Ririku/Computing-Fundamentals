				Family <br>
				[noun]<br>
				life's greatest blessing. a group that dreams, laughs and loves together. those whom you can always count on.
				always present not only in the good times. the most precious gift.<br>
				<br>
				"Regardless of what form family might take for you, one thing is certain â€“ family shapes us. 
				Our family is our first introduction to the world. It is also our first interaction with it. 
				We learn the most basic and the most important social skills from our family. 
				In addition, we also fulfil our emotional needs through them.
				Human beings are social animals, something that means that it is not possible for us to lead entirely solitary lives. 
				Modern life is tough and stressful. Handling it becomes a lot easier if you have a support system behind you. 
				That support system is your family." 
				<br>
				Hi i'm Sharrie Ann Marie Galingan Mitabtab <br>
				the eldest one to the daughter of two <br>
				
				I really have nothing much to say because just like other family we have our own ups and downs
				but at the end of the day we still love each other no matter what.
				<br>
				But to be honest, i may be like the other teen that don't really show affection to their parents but
				i know taht I cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side. 
				Family is very important and valuable to me and is something that should never be taken for granted, without my family, a 
				large part of my life and myself would be missing.
				I am blessed to say that i can say that i have my mom, dad, grandpa, grandma, sister with me because let's face reality
				not all people has a complete family.
				<br>
				I may say i hate them out of anger but deep in my heart they play a big role in my life because without them i am not here sharing this to you.
				</br></p>
